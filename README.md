# ASA-Start-batch-file
Start bat for Ark Survival Ascended. WIP, what it does right now is auto updates game files before starting server. Detects when server is no longer running and automatically starts it back up. The monitor will display update, time server started, time server is going to restart (wip: auto restarts do not work at the moment this is still a work in progress.), and a counter of how many restarts have occured. If you close the monitor than it cannot detect if server goes down to start it back up so it is important to leave the monitor running for this to work properly. You will need to right click on the bat file and open it with notepad or notepad++ to fill in required lines with your information.
